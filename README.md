## About

**Philosophers** is a solution to the classic Dining Philosophers problem, demonstrating synchronization in concurrent programming using threads and mutexes. This project implements a simulation where philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping while avoiding deadlock and starvation.

## Problem Overview

The Dining Philosophers problem involves:
- **N philosophers** sitting at a round table
- **N forks** (one between each pair of philosophers)
- Each philosopher needs **two forks** to eat
- Philosophers must **avoid deadlock** (circular wait)
- Philosophers must **avoid starvation** (never getting to eat)

### Philosopher States
- **Eating**: Holding two forks, consuming spaghetti
- **Thinking**: Pondering philosophy
- **Sleeping**: Resting after eating
- **Dead**: Failed to eat within time limit

## Program Specifications

### Command Line Arguments
```bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_meals]
```

| Argument | Description | Units |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `number_of_philosophers` | Number of philosophers/forks | integer |
| `time_to_die` | Max time without eating before death | milliseconds |
| `time_to_eat` | Time required to eat | milliseconds |
| `time_to_sleep` | Time spent sleeping | milliseconds |
| `number_of_meals` (optional) | Simulation stops after each philosopher eats this many times | integer |

### Output Format
```
timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
timestamp_in_ms X is eating
timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
timestamp_in_ms X died
```

### Requirements
- **No data races** or synchronization issues
- **Death detection** within 10ms of actual death
- **No message overlap** in output
- **No global variables**
- **Proper cleanup** of resources

## Installation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/viridian-green/Philosophers.git
cd philosophers
make
```

### Running the Simulation
```bash
# Basic simulation (stops when philosopher dies)
./philo 5 800 200 200

# Simulation with meal limit (stops after each eats 7 times)
./philo 5 800 200 200 7

# Single philosopher scenario (will die)
./philo 1 800 200 200
```

### Example Output
```
0 1 has taken a fork
0 1 has taken a fork
0 1 is eating
200 1 is sleeping
400 1 is thinking
400 1 has taken a fork
400 1 has taken a fork
400 1 is eating
```

## Algorithm Strategy

### Synchronization Approach
- **Mutex-protected forks**: Each fork has a mutex lock
- **Thread per philosopher**: Each philosopher runs in separate thread
- **Timing precision**: Microsecond accuracy using `gettimeofday()`
- **Death monitoring**: Separate thread or main thread checks status

### Deadlock Prevention
- **Asymmetric picking**: Odd/even philosophers pick forks in different order
- **Timeout mechanisms**: Prevent infinite waiting
- **Resource hierarchy**: Ordered fork acquisition

### Starvation Avoidance
- **Fair scheduling**: Ensure all philosophers get access to resources
- **Priority management**: Prevent philosopher monopolization
- **Efficient sleeping**: Proper usleep implementation with time checking

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Thread Management
- **Philosopher threads**: Simulate philosopher behavior
- **Monitor thread**: Checks for deaths and meal completion
- **Mutex synchronization**: Protects shared resources

#### Meal Limit Testing
```bash
# Should stop after 7 meals each
./philo 3 800 200 200 7

# Verify all philosophers eat required meals
./philo 4 800 200 200 5 | grep "is eating" | wc -l
```

#### Edge Cases
```bash
# Large number of philosophers
./philo 200 800 200 200

# Very short times
./philo 5 100 50 50

# Very long simulation
./philo 5 10000 1000 1000
```

### Validation Criteria
- **No data races**: Use thread sanitizers or valgrind
- **Proper death timing**: Death within 10ms of starvation
- **No message overlap**: Clean, sequential output
- **Resource cleanup**: No memory leaks or mutex leaks
- **Correct meal counting**: Accurate tracking when meal goal specified

## Makefile Targets

```bash
make        # Compile philo executable
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove object files and executable
make re     # Clean and recompile
```


## Dependencies

- **pthread**: POSIX threads library
- **Standard C Library**: malloc, free, printf, write, usleep, gettimeofday

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Deadlock Prevention
- Implement asymmetric fork picking strategy
- Use timeout mechanisms for fork acquisition
- Consider adding a "arbitrator" or "waiter" thread

### Performance Issues
- Avoid busy waiting with proper usleep
- Minimize mutex locking time
- Use efficient time calculation methods

### Race Conditions
- Protect all shared data with mutexes
- Use proper memory barriers
- Test with thread sanitizers
